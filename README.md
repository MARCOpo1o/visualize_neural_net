## Introduction
This is a project to showcase what each layer of neuron is highlighting. This project is aimed to display what deeper feature map layers of neuron are doing. 

## How to use
Switch to addConnections branch to see the codes.

## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks are at the core of state-of-the-art approaches to a variety of computer vision tasks. Visualizations of neural networks typically take the form of static node-link diagrams, which illustrate only the structure of a network, rather than the behavior. Motivated by this observation, this project presents a new interactive visualization of neural networks trained on handwritten digit recognition, with the intent of showing the actual behavior of the network given user-provided input. The user can interact with the network through a drawing pad, and watch the activation patterns of the network respond in real time.
